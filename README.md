# Handwritten Number Recognition

## Overview
This project is a machine learning model that is able to recognize handwritten numbers. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 images of handwritten digits. The model is able to recognize digits with an accuracy of over 87%.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model will be the [Dogs vs Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) dataset which contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats. Each image is labeled as either "dog" or "cat".

## Requirements
- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- Keras
- Sklearn

## Usage
The project can be run using the command line:
```
python main.py
```
## Model
The model used in this project is a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented using the Keras library with TensorFlow as the backend.

## Evaluation
The model will be evaluated using the accuracy metric on the test set.

## Conclusion
This project is a demonstration of how machine learning can be used to classify images of dogs and cats. The model was able to achieve a high level of accuracy, and can be further improved by using more data and fine-tuning the model's parameters.
