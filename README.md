# Project Title: Dog and Cat Image Classification

## Overview
This project is focused on creating a machine learning model to classify images as either a dog or a cat. The model will be trained using a dataset of labeled images and then tested on a set of new, unseen images. The goal is to achieve a high level of accuracy in classifying new images.

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and testing the model will be the [Dogs vs Cats](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats) dataset which contains 25,000 images of dogs and cats. Each image is labeled as either "dog" or "cat".

## Requirements
- Python 3
- TensorFlow
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- Keras
- Sklearn

## Usage
The project can be run using the command line:
```
python main.py
```
## Model
The model used in this project is a convolutional neural network (CNN) implemented using the Keras library with TensorFlow as the backend.

## Evaluation
The model will be evaluated using the accuracy metric on the test set.

## Conclusion
This project is a demonstration of how machine learning can be used to classify images of dogs and cats. The model was able to achieve a high level of accuracy, and can be further improved by using more data and fine-tuning the model's parameters.
